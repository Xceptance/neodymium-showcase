# Introduction
This repository is a showcase project to demonstrate the usage of several features of the [Neodymium Library](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-library).



# Content
Below is a summary of the content from this project.

## 1. Shadow DOM
The `showcase.neodymium.tests.shadowdom` package contains the use cases for the shadow DOM automation. Please also have a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-library/wiki/Shadow-DOM-Testing) for more information.
#### 1.1 General Shadow DOM
In `TextTest.java` you can find a simple use case on how to automatically test shadow DOM elements.
#### 1.2. Nested Shadow DOM
`CheckboxTest.java` contains more sophisticated use cases for shadow DOM including nested shadow DOMs. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-library/wiki/Shadow-DOM-Testing).

## 2. Localization
The tests in the `showcase.neodymium.tests.localization` package highlight how the [localization](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-library/wiki/Localization) feature of neodymium is used. Note that all the translated strings and their keys can be found in the `config/localization.yaml` file.
